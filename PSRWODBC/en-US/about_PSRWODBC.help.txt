LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSRWODBC provides funtions for querying your school's RenWeb Database.

    Before you can do this, you will need to contact RenWeb to obtain ODBC access to your database.  Technical support can assist you with this process.  There is a fee involved.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    This is a basic module that provides a few functions for connecting to and querying the RenWeb database through an ODBC connection.

RenWeb provides read-only access to your data through this connection, so this module only allows you to go one-way with the data.  In other words, you can retrieve data, but you cannot change or add data.

This version of the module relies on the sqlps module.  This module requires Windows Powershell Extensions for SQL server 2016.  These are available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52676.  Specifically, the components required are: SQLSysClrTypes.msi, SharedManagementObjects.msi, and PowerShellTools.msi.
